# 0x0A-argc_argv 

This project it's about:

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Tasks:

 - **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**

	A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

	If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again

 - **1. Silence is argument carried out by other means**

	A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
	The program should print a number, followed by a new line.

 - **2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**

	A program that prints all arguments it receives.

	All arguments should be printed, including the first one.
	Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line.
 - **3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**

	A program that multiplies two numbers.

	The program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
	If the program does not receive two arguments, the program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1.

 - **4. To infinity and beyond**

	A program that adds positive numbers.

	Print the result, followed by a new line.
	If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line.
	If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1.
