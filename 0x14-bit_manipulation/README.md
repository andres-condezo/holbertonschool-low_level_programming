# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

This project it's about:

- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.

## Tasks:

 - **0-binary_to_uint.c**

 A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

 - **1-print_binary.c**

 A function that prints the binary representation of a number.

 - **2-get_bit.c**

 A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

 - **3-set_bit.c**

 A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at aiven index.

 - **4-clear_bit.c**

 A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at aiven index.

 - **5-flip_bits.c**

 A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
