# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

This project it's about:

- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Tasks:

 - **0. What's my name**
 - **1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll neveret it done**
 - **2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities**
 - **3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at**
